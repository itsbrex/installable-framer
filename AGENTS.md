Before starting to work on the user task run `git ls-files | tree --fromfile` to see the structure of the project

The main folder is unframer. This is the core of the codebase, the cli that let you download Unframer components as React code.

Ignore folders like framer-chunks and framer.js which are generated, they contain the Framer website runtime.

Folder that starts with framer- in nextjs-app and other apps are generated by the unframer cli.

Before working on the user task read relevant files inside unframer folder to see how the project works.

## Feedback loop

Running validation of changes

- run `pnpm build` from repo root to start compiling the project and watch for changes
- run `pnpm --filter nextjs-app framer-simplicity` to generate the code using unframer inside nextjs-app/src/framer-simplicity. this is a complex and rich project you can use to see what unframer generates and validate fixes or issues.
- you can add logs, then try generating again to inspect data and fields of objects managed by Unframer cli and fix issues.
