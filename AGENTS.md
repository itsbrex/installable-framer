Running validation of changes

- run `pnpm build` from repo root to start compiling the project and watch for changes
- run `pnpm --filter nextjs-app framer-simplicity` to generate the code using unframer inside nextjs-app/src/framer-simplicity. this is a complex and rich project you can use to see what unframer generates and validate fixes or issues.
